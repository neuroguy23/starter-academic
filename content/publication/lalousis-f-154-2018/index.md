abstract: Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) often lead to distress and functional
  disability, and are frequently associated with psychotic illness. Theories of abnormal
  integration have been proposed to explain symptoms of schizophrenia, including delusions
  and hallucinations, with a central abnormality being aberrant activity in intrinsic
  brain networks such as the default mode network (DMN) or the salience network (SN).
  Previous investigations of patients with schizophrenia assessing functional connectivity
  (FC) have used a seed-based functional connectivity approach (sb-FC), with seed
  placement in brain areas responsible for auditory processing, language, and memory;
  the striatum, and in areas of DMN. These have generated some conflicting results,
  possibly because of the varying seed placement. The aim of the current study was
  to address these confounding factors by investigating the intrinsic FC in first
  episode psychosis (FEP) patients with AVH using within-sample AVH symptom capture
  seeds. It was hypothesised that patients would show aberrant resting state FC between
  areas of the DMN and SN and these areas.Eighteen FEP individuals and 20 healthy
  controls were recruited. All the participants underwent resting-state functional
  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI). The Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State
  fMRI Advanced Edition (DPARSFA) V3.1 (http://rfmri.org/DPARSF) (Yan &amp; Zang,
  2010) and the statistical parametric mapping software 8 (SPM8) (SPM, Friston, The
  Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, Uk; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm)
  were used to preprocess and analyze the data.Patients showed increased FC between
  left insula and bilateral cerebellum, and angular gyrus; and increased FC between
  left claustrum and left cerebellum and postcentral gyrus. There was reduced FC in
  FEP patients with AVH between left claustrum and left insula compared to HC. The
  FC between left insula and left claustrum seeds for patients and HC is shown separately
  in supplementary information. There were no significant correlations between DUP,
  dose of antipsychotic medications, and severity of hallucinations and the mean coefficients
  of clusters that were significantly different between FEP patients and HC.FEP patients
  showed increased functional connectivity between left insula and bilateral cerebellum
  and angular gyrus; and increased functional connectivity between left claustrum
  and left cerebellum and postcentral gyrus. We also found reduced functional connectivity
  between left claustrum and left insula in FEP patients compared to HC. It is possible
  the pathology of AVH is primarily located in the insula and angular gyrus. However,
  given our results of both the left insula seed in patients and HC shows connectivity
  with right insula and anterior cingulate cortex (key regions of SN) and literature
  from patients with chronic AVH, the suggestion may be that resting state dysconnectivity
  within the DMN and SN are implicated in the generation of AVH, which during the
  experience itself will further involve temporal and auditory networks. Furthermore,
  decreased intrinsic functional connectivity between the claustrum and the insula
  may lead to compensatory over activity in parts of the auditory network including
  areas involved in DMN, auditory processing, language and memory, leading to the
  complex and individual content of AVH when they occur.
