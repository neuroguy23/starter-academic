abstract: 'Depression frequently occurs in first-episode psychosis (FEP) and predicts
  longer-term negative outcomes. It is possible that this depression is seen primarily
  in a distinct subgroup, which if identified could allow targeted treatments. We
  hypothesize that patients with recent-onset psychosis (ROP) and comorbid depression
  would be identifiable by symptoms and neuroanatomical features similar to those
  seen in recent-onset depression (ROD). Data were extracted from the multisite PRONIA
  study: 154 ROP patients (FEP within 3 months of treatment onset), of whom 83 were
  depressed (ROP+D) and 71 who were not depressed (ROP−D), 146 ROD patients, and 265
  healthy controls (HC). Analyses included a (1) principal component analysis that
  established the similar symptom structure of depression in ROD and ROP+D, (2) supervised
  machine learning (ML) classification with repeated nested cross-validation based
  on depressive symptoms separating ROD vs ROP+D, which achieved a balanced accuracy
  (BAC) of 51%, and (3) neuroanatomical ML-based classification, using regions of
  interest generated from ROD subjects, which identified BAC of 50% (no better than
  chance) for separation of ROP+D vs ROP−D. We conclude that depression at a symptom
  level is broadly similar with or without psychosis status in recent-onset disorders;
  however, this is not driven by a separable depressed subgroup in FEP. Depression
  may be intrinsic to early stages of psychotic disorder, and thus treating depression
  could produce widespread benefit.'
