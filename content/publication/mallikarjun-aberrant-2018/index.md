abstract: Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) often lead to distress and functional
  disability, and are frequently associated with psychotic illness. Previously both
  state and trait magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of AVH have identified
  activity in brain regions involving auditory processing, language, memory and areas
  of default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN). Current evidence is clouded
  by research mainly in participants on long-term medication, with chronic illness
  and by choice of seed regions made ‘a priori’. Thus, the aim of this study was to
  elucidate the intrinsic functional connectivity in patients presenting with first
  episode psychosis (FEP). Resting state functional MRI data were available from 18
  FEP patients, 9 of whom also experienced AVH of sufficient duration in the scanner
  and had symptom capture functional MRI (sc fMRI), together with 18 healthy controls.
  Symptom capture results were used to accurately identify specific brain regions
  active during AVH; including the superior temporal cortex, insula, precuneus, posterior
  cingulate and parahippocampal complex. Using these as seed regions, patients with
  FEP and AVH showed increased resting sb-FC between parts of the SN and the DMN and
  between the SN and the cerebellum, but reduced sb-FC between the claustrum and the
  insula, compared to healthy controls.It is possible that aberrant activity within
  the DMN and SN complex may be directly linked to impaired salience appraisal of
  internal activity and AVH generation. Furthermore, decreased intrinsic functional
  connectivity between the claustrum and the insula may lead to compensatory over
  activity in parts of the auditory network including areas involved in DMN, auditory
  processing, language and memory, potentially related to the complex and individual
  content of AVH when they occur.
