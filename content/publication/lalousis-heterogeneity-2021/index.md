abstract: 'Diagnostic heterogeneity within and across psychotic and affective disorders
  challenges accurate treatment selection, particularly in the early stages. Delineation
  of shared and distinct illness features at the phenotypic and brain levels may inform
  the development of more precise differential diagnostic tools. We aimed to identify
  prototypes of depression and psychosis to investigate their heterogeneity, with
  common, comorbid transdiagnostic symptoms. Analyzing clinical/neurocognitive and
  grey matter volume (GMV) data from the PRONIA database, we generated prototypic
  models of recent-onset depression (ROD) vs. recent-onset psychosis (ROP) by training
  support-vector machines to separate patients with ROD from patients with ROP, who
  were selected for absent comorbid features (pure groups). Then, models were applied
  to patients with comorbidity, ie, ROP with depressive symptoms (ROP+D) and ROD participants
  with sub-threshold psychosis-like features (ROD+P), to measure their positions within
  the affective-psychotic continuum. All models were independently validated in a
  replication sample. Comorbid patients were positioned between pure groups, with
  ROP+D patients being more frequently classified as ROD compared to pure ROP patients
  (clinical/neurocognitive model: χ2 = 14.874; P &lt; .001; GMV model: χ2 = 4.933;
  P = .026). ROD+P patient classification did not differ from ROD (clinical/neurocognitive
  model: χ2 = 1.956; P = 0.162; GMV model: χ2 = 0.005; P = .943). Clinical/neurocognitive
  and neuroanatomical models demonstrated separability of prototypic depression from
  psychosis. The shift of comorbid patients toward the depression prototype, observed
  at the clinical and biological levels, suggests that psychosis with affective comorbidity
  aligns more strongly to depressive rather than psychotic disease processes. Future
  studies should assess how these quantitative measures of comorbidity predict outcomes
  and individual responses to stratified therapeutic interventions.'
