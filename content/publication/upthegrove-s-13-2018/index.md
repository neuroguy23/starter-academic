abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental
  disorders, with a lifetime prevalence of 14.6%. The impact of depression is considerable;
  poor social and economic functioning and significant life limitations [1]. Depression
  is also the most common co-morbidity seen with other mental disorders. The prevalence
  of depressive disorder in schizophrenia has been reported to be around 40% [2].
  When examining very early phases of illness, in groups identified as at clinical
  high risk (CHR) for psychosis, high rates of ‘co-morbid’ axis one diagnoses are
  reported, with over 50% reaching criteria for a depressive disorder. Those people
  with schizophrenia send depression are significantly more likely to relapse, to
  be a safety concern (be arrested, victimized or suicidal), have greater substance-related
  problems and poorer recovery [2]. In addition, depression has been linked to increased
  risk of transition from CHR to FEP, suggesting that in this group depression also
  indicates a poorer outcome [3]. Currently, the diagnosis of depression is based
  on the phenomenological evaluation of symptoms and behavior. However, there remains
  significant debate around the heterogeneity of depressive symptoms and their function
  as prognostic indicators [4]. Neuroimaging holds “diagnostic potential” for depression
  [5]. However, studies show that brain alterations are often small and reliability
  is difficult, and there has been no neuroimaging investigation of depression as
  a co-morbid diagnosis. We aim to further understand the symptom profile of depression
  in emerging mental disorders, including in the clinical high risk group (CHR) and
  recent onset psychosis (ROP) as compared to those with recent onset depression (ROD).
  This has important implications for the accurate identification of a potentially
  malleable target for treatment, and indeed development of novel therapeutic options.
  We also aim to explore the ability of brain imagining (structural MRI) to add accuracy
  to the classification prediction models  Methods Data from the PRONIA study, an
  EUFP7 funded 8 center study recruiting ROD, CHR and ROP participants will be presented.
  Analysis will include demographic information and BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory),
  CAARMS (Comprehensive Assessment of the At Risk Mental State), SANS (Scale for the
  assessment of negative symptoms) total score PANSS (Positive and negative Symptom
  Score) and SPI-A together with structural MRI imaging. We will report descriptive
  detail from the PRONIA discovery sample (n716), machine learning classification
  with Neurominer® and VBM analysis of sMRI scans across groups.  Results Data from
  BDI-II symptom endorsement suggests a ‘classical depression phenotype’ corresponding
  to Becks ‘cognitive triad’; “life is pointless, future hopeless, self as worthless”
  may separate depression in ROD from ROP, with other symptoms potentially able to
  separate ROP from ROD. In classification, a 65% sensitivity and specificity are
  found. Data will also be presented on the CHR group and their alignment, together
  with VBM analysis for structural MRI examining correlates with highly weighted classifying
  symptoms in and across all three groups.  Discussion When given early in the course
  of illness, interventions have the greatest potential impact, and characterization
  and accurate diagnosis of depression in emerging mental disorders is an important
  goal. This study suggests it may be possible to accurately identify depression in
  different diagnostic categories, including major depressive disorder, psychosis
  and clinical high risk, and that neuroimaging holds potential to add to diagnostic
  accuracy in complex co-morbid disorders.
