abstract: Background Functional brain imaging studies of working memory in people
  with schizophrenia have reported divergent reports with some studies reporting hypofrontal
  activation while report hypofrontal activation. The inconsistencies in the literature
  have been postulated to be related to task requirements or poor task performance
  in schizophrenia. An alternative hypothesis proposed is that different regions within
  the PFC show either hypo or hyperactivity, depending on their location. In view
  of the inconsistencies in previous research, the aim of the current research is
  to examine abnormalities in a cohort of partially remitted people with schizophrenia
  and matched controls  Methods Twenty people with schizophrenia and 20 matched healthy
  controls (matched on age, gender and parental social and economic status) were selected
  from the Nottingham area to undergo a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
  scan while undergoing two levels of the visual n-back task (zeroback and two back).
  The behavioural results (latency and accuracy) on the nback task was compared using
  repeated measures analysis. The MR images were reoriented, realigned, co-registered
  to the T1-weighted anatomical image, and normalised to the MNI space. Normalised
  images were resliced to a voxel size of 3 mm3, smoothed with an 8 mm full-width
  half-maximum Gaussian kernel using SPM 5. The GLM approach implemented in SPM 5
  was utilized for fMRI data modeling and analyses. Each epoch type (zero-back, two-back
  and rest) was modeled in a boxcar design, using a canonical hemodynamic response
  function and its temporal derivative. The single group second level analysis consisted
  of voxelwise one-sample t-tests with significance threshold set at voxel level p
  textless .05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple comparisons across
  the entire brain., The between-group comparison employed voxelwise two sample t-tests
  with the significance criterion based on the spatial extent of suprathreshold voxel
  clusters, a method proposed by (Friston et al., 1994). The criterion for inclusion
  of a voxel in a cluster was set at p textless .05 (uncorrected) and a cluster was
  considered as significant at level of p textless .05 (corrected).  Results Patients
  exhibited relatively high general function and mild symptoms, but had significantly
  longer reaction time and decline in performance. Both controls and patients activated
  similar set of brain regions similar to Central executive network and deactivated
  brain areas comprising the default mode network. Most noteworthy, we did not find
  evidence for hypofrontality (reduced activity in DLPFC in patients compared to controls)
  in this study. Compared to controls, patients showed areas of greater activation
  in left postcentral gyrus, anterior and posterior medial frontal gyrus and left
  superior temporal gyrus.  Discussion Both controls and patients showed activation
  in widespread brain areas consistent with the CEN, and deactivation in areas consistent
  with DMN regions. There was no evidence of hypofrontality in this sample of remitted
  people with schizophrenia. Patients showed activation patterns on the zeroback task
  similar to the activation patterns for controls on the two back task, suggesting
  that patients showed increased brain activation on a task with lesser requirements,
  though behavioural results suggest inefficiency despite the increased effort.
